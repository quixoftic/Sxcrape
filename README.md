# Sxcrape

Sxcrape is a collection of tools for scraping the SXSW music show
schedule (known officially as the "Music Showcase"), and presenting it
as machine-consumable JSON via a simple REST API.

Currently, it consists of two tools:

* `sxcrape`, which parses the schedule from the official [SXSW
Schedule website](http://schedule.sxsw.com/) and creates, for each
event, a file containing the JSON representation of the event details
-- artist name, venue, showtime, etc.
* `sxred`, which imports event pages as JSON into a Redis database.

A simple REST service for serving the JSON representation to HTTP
clients will be forthcoming.

## Caveats

Sxcrape is very year-dependent. The current version is only capable of
parsing the 2012 music event schedule, and not any earlier years, nor
any other type of SXSW event. If the differences between the 2011 and
2012 versions of the [SXSW Schedule
website](http://schedule.sxsw.com/) are any indication, Sxcrape's
scraper will certainly need to be rewritten in order to parse the 2013
SXSW music schedule. We intend to do so soon after SXSW makes their
2013 schedule available.

## Per-event JSON representation

The scraper extracts the following information from each music event
page:

* Artist name, origin (e.g., San Francisco, CA), and website.
* Venue name, address, and age restrictions.
* Performance date.
* Scheduled start and end times.
* The genre/category assigned to the artist by SXSW.
* A description of the artist, the artist's latest album, etc.
* An image of the artist.
* A link to one of the artist's songs.
* A link to one of the artist's music videos.
* SXSW's recommended Twitter hashtags for the event.

The data are represented as name/value pairs in a JSON object, which
contains one object for the event, one for the artist, and one for the
venue. The event object contains the names of the artist and venue for
the purpose of establishing relationships in a database. Often, one or
more values are missing; these are represented in the JSON as null
values.

Here's an example of the JSON output from the `sxcrape` tool for the
[March 14, 2012 performance by Paper
Diamond](http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_MS19763). The
first element in the list is the event details, the second is the
artist details, and the third is the venue details:
